Allocator

My own allocator implementation in C with automatic cleanup.

Inspiration: https://arjunsreedharan.org/post/148675821737/memory-allocators-101-write-a-simple-memory

Agenda: 
- Improve performance, O(1) time complexity for malloc. Needs research though
  - Bitmap?
- Make sure malloc never returns null, or allow for a safe exit
- Compile time optimizations for all functions - inlining, __builtin_expect and hot functions
- Avoid global lock
